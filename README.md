Dr. STRANGE

Stephen Vincent Strange a.k.a Dr. Strange is a powerful sorcerer and Master of the Mystic Arts. Originally a brilliant yet arrogant neurosurgeon, Strange had suffered a car accident, resulting in his hands becoming crippled. When Western medicine failed him, Strange embarked on a journey that led him to Kamar-Taj where Strange had made the discovery of magic and alternate dimensions, being trained by the Ancient One. Though focused on healing his hands, Strange learned more of the mystic arts and helped the Masters prevent Kaecilius from merging Earth with their Dark Dimension, but not before witnessing the Ancient One's death. With the demise of his mentor, Strange became the protector of the New York Sanctum within New York City as well as Earth's protector from any inter-dimensional threats.
